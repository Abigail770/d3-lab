        <h2>A look into homelessness in 2018</h2>

                <div class="panel">
                  <p><br>Even since recovering from the 2008 recession, homelessness remains a prevalent issue in Spain.  Part of this problem is due to a lack of public housing, stemming from the 1960's with government tax breaks for homeowners - as a result, little public housing was constructed. Now, many empty privately-owned housing units have become home to squatters.</p>

                <div class="panel">
                  <p><br>Overall, Spain enjoys a relatively high standard of living compared to many other countries.  However, there is a large income gap between the wealthy and those in poverty: the top 20% earn almost 7 times that of the poorest 20%.</p>
                </div>
                <br/>
            <button class="accordion">Access to Resources</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p><br>Although the homeless population continues to rise in Spain, efforts have been made to expand resources like shelters.  According to a study conducted by Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, the capacity of the housing network for homeless people increased from 13,033 in 2006 to 16,346 in 2012.</p>
